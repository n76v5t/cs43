3. SQ 3 State the definition of a Hamiltonian cycle.
4. SQ 4 What is the chromatic number of K5? Briefly explain your answer.
5. SQ 5 How many passwords of length 7 created from an alphabet of size 36 have at least one repeated entry? For example, abca1a3 has at least one repeated entry but abcd123 does not.
6. SQ 6 How many ways are there to form. two groups of 7 people and one group of 5 people from a collection of 19 people?
7. SQ 7 Given a weighted, connected graph G = (V,E), describe Kruskal’s algorithm and the output of Kruskal’s algorithm.
8. SQ 8 Suppose that G1 = (V1, E1) is isomorphic to G2 = (V2, E2). State four properties of the graphs that must be the same. (For example, |V1| = |V2|.)
